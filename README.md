This repository is to hold the code requried to analyse prevalence and growth rates of different lineages.

It consists of the following files:

* ``methods.pdf`` containing a full mathematical description of the methods;
* ``ONS_day_lineage.csv`` containing a list of study days of sample and lineage;
* ``lineage.py`` containing helper Python functions;
* ``fit_lineages.ipynb`` containing interactive Python code for fitting the prevalence and growth rate model to data;
* ``/output/`` directory containing output from the fitting;
* ``paper_plots.nb`` showing how output can be imported to different software (in this case Mathematica) for re-analysis.
